# Weekly-Challenges
Weekly (now yearly) challenges between me and friends

## How does this work?
 # Each Week a Random Programming (and non) Language gets picked.
 # Along with the language a general concept (3 words or less) gets picked.

## Rules
 # As long as the Main file is the required language the project counts.
 # The Project must strictly follow the Concept given
 # Project must be Runnable from the get go, if not provide with a Readme or a list of packages / dependencies to get before the end of the period

 
i will update this readme and repo whenever new projects come up
